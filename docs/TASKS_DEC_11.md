## Mobile menu
I cannot access or navigate to our main pages from mobile. the header does not include all navigation options. I would like a hamburger menu icon in the top for easily accessing the key main pages (machines, players, teams, venues, matches, any others?)

## Machines details

### Score Distribution Summary 
remove one of the score columns. I like the formatted column use to reduce width 22M instead of 22,000,000

### Score Distribution Chart 
too tall container on mobile

### Filters
standardize filters

## Main Page

### NAvigation Cards
add for additional pages

## Player

### Linking
linking fails on mobile live site

### machine statistics table 
reformat into multiple line rows to fit on mobile

### Scores
reformat scores for 22M 16k

### Score Progression chart
reformat score progression for mobile

score progression table does not need mini-details hover

Machines List
-reformat to fit on mobile

## All tables and charts
Should be formatted for viewing on mobile

On desktop, many tables have too much whitespace as they are formatted to use all horizontal space. I prefer the tables to be more tightly contained for easier viewing across a row
